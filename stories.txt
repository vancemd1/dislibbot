This is an example story. It's a $ADJECTIVE story, too, free for you to $VERB as much as you want. Free and open source $NOUN is nice that way, isn't it? If you $ANOTHER_VERB this repo and contribute to it, maybe $TECH_CELEBRITY will notice and be impressed. But more likely, you and your $NUMBER friends will have fun with it while you're all $PRESENT_TENSE_VERB on Discord.
This is another story. I $PAST_TENSE_VERB it because the code needs to handle multiple stories $ADJECTIVE_ENDING_IN_LY and I wanted to test it. It isn't meant to be $ANOTHER_ADJECTIVE but maybe you and your $FAMILY_MEMBER will find it humorous.
